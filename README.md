Python SDK Quick Start
======================================================

This small Python project shows the finished result of the [Python SDK Quick Start](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/python_quickstart) instructions provided in the Cloudinary documentation.

Feel free to fork this project, enter your credentials in the `.env` file, and get started playing with the Cloudinary Python SDK. However, keep in mind that the intention of this code is to help developers quickly get started using several common Cloudinary features. It doesn't necessarily employ coding best practices and the code isn't intended for production.
